# IRS Tax Form Processing in Flexile

## Overview

Flexile automatically generates and prefills IRS tax forms for contractors and investors. These forms are generated based on user compliance information, payment history, and company relationships. Forms are generated as PDFs and made available for download in the Documents section.

## Tax Form Generation Timeline

- **January 5th**: Email reminders sent to company administrators to update missing tax details (`CompanyAdministratorTaxDetailsReminderJob`)
- **January 10th**: Email reminders sent to company workers to add/update their tax information (`CompanyWorkerTaxInfoReminderEmailJob`)
- **January 31st**: Tax form review job runs (`TaxFormReviewJob`) which:
  - Generates all IRS tax forms for eligible users
  - Sends review reminder emails to company administrators and users

## Document Lifecycle

1. **Generation**: Forms are created when users confirm tax information or during scheduled batch processing
2. **Review**: Users and administrators review forms for accuracy
3. **Filing**: Company administrators file forms with the IRS (currently manual process)
4. **Completion**: Forms should be marked as "filed" once submitted to the IRS
5. **Preservation**: Filed forms must be preserved even if user tax information changes

## How Forms are Generated

1. `TaxFormReviewJob` collects compliance information for company workers and investors
2. This job triggers `GenerateIrsTaxFormsJob` for each user compliance record
3. `GenerateIrsTaxFormsJob` creates appropriate tax documents based on:
   - User's tax residency status (US vs non-US)
   - Type of payments received (contractor payments vs dividends)
4. Form data is populated using form-specific data generators:
   - `Irs::Form1099necDataGenerator`
   - `Irs::Form1099divDataGenerator`
   - `Irs::Form1042sDataGenerator`
5. PDFs are prefilled and stored as document attachments using [`hexapdf` gem.](https://hexapdf.gettalong.org/)

## Step-by-Step Processes

### 1. Tax Form Generation Process

1. **Check User Eligibility**:
   - Verify user has completed tax information
   - Check if user has payments/dividends in the tax year
   - Determine appropriate form type (1099-NEC, 1099-DIV, or 1042-S)
2. **Form Data Generation**:

   ```ruby
   # Example for 1099-NEC
   user_compliance_info = UserComplianceInfo.find(user_compliance_info_id)
   company = company_id ? Company.find(company_id) : user_compliance_info.user.company_workers.first.company

   # Generate form data
   generator = Irs::Form1099necDataGenerator.new(user_compliance_info:, company:, tax_year:)
   form_data = generator.generate

   ```

3. **PDF Creation**:

   ```ruby
   # Create document record
   document = Document.create!(
     name: TaxDocument::FORM_1099_NEC,
     document_type: :tax_document,
     year: tax_year,
     company: company,
     user_compliance_info: user_compliance_info
   )

   # Serialize data for PDF prefilling
   serializer = document.fetch_serializer
   serialized_data = serializer.serialized_attributes

   # Generate prefilled PDF
   pdf_service = PrefilledPdfService.new(
     template_path: "config/data/tax_forms/1099-NEC.pdf",
     form_data: serialized_data
   )
   pdf_content = pdf_service.generate

   # Attach to document
   document.attachments.attach(
     io: StringIO.new(pdf_content),
     filename: "#{document.name}_#{tax_year}_#{company.name}.pdf",
     content_type: "application/pdf"
   )

   ```

### 2. Filing Process (Current Manual)

1. **Generate IRS File**:

   ```ruby
   # Run generator for appropriate form
   generator = Irs::Form1099necDataGenerator.new(company: company, tax_year: tax_year)
   output_file = generator.generate_combined_irs_file

   # Download file
   File.open(output_file, "r") do |file|
     send_data file.read,
               filename: "1099NEC_#{company.name}_#{tax_year}.txt",
               type: "text/plain"
   end

   ```

2. **Upload to IRS FIRE System**:
   - Login to FIRE system
   - Upload the generated file
   - Verify acceptance and copy details to be able to check after a couple of days if the report was processed successfully
3. **Mark Forms as Filed**:

   ```ruby
   # Mark all relevant documents as filed
   Document.where(
     company:,
     tax_year:,
     name: TaxDocument::FORM_1099_NEC,
   ).includes(user_compliance_info: :user).find_each do |document|
     document.signatures.create!(title: "Signer", user: document.user_compliance_info.user, signed_at: Time.current)
   end

   ```

## Troubleshooting

- Whenever a contractor/investor needs their tax form adjusted or regenerated, it's best to just mark the old document as deleted via `document.mark_deleted!` and regenerate a new one using the https://github.com/antiwork/flexile/blob/main/apps/rails/app/services/generate_tax_form_service.rb.
