    <h1>Big congratulations - you are officially joining the {company.name} team!</h1>

    <p>
      Here's some great news: Your rate has been bumped up to {formatMoneyFromCents(newPayRateInSubunits)} per hour from
      the previous trial rate of {formatMoneyFromCents(oldPayRateInSubunits)}. You'll see this updated rate on your next
      invoice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, you now have the option to convert a portion of your cash earnings to equity in the company. Just keep in
      mind, once you decide on the percentage, it will be locked in for the year.
    </p>

    <p>Welcome aboard!</p>
